Welcome to my first finished django project! 

I may have been following a tutorial, but by-golly, I did it! 

There are still a lot of changes that I need to make in order to make this 
website look and act like a fully-fledged blog site, but this is a good start! 

The website is hosted online at http://jwinf843.pythonanywhere.com/, so feel
free to check out the finished project for yourself! 

The following are some links to help with editing in the future

## Tutorial Link
https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/

## C9 Run Server Preview Command: 
python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8080

## C9 Preview Link (Make sure the preview server is running first!)
https://blagg-dfg-jwinf843.c9users.io

## Pythonanywhere Bash Console Link

## GitHub Repo (You probably already found this)
https://github.com/jwinf843/my-django-blog



```
The Following is a list of changes I'd like to make in the future
```
## Font Changes
* The Post Detail, New Post and Edit Post pages have their headers in Comic Sans 
for some reason, this should probably be rectified as soon as soon as I can 
muster the willpower

## Stylistic Changes
* Posts should be ordered in reverse order by their published_date

* Font color should be uniform grey

* Background should be updated to be black (or any night-setting theme)
